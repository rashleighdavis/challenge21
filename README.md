## Challenge: Martian Token Crowdsale

You will create a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a `Crowdsale` contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract that you create will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. Your contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

### Instructions

The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

1. Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract

2. Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract

3. Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract

4. Deploy the Crowdsale to a Local Blockchain

5. Optional: Extend the Crowdsale Contract by Using OpenZeppelin

#### Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract

In this section, you will create a smart contract that defines KaseiCoin as an ERC-20 token. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Import the provided `KaseiCoin.sol` starter file into the Remix IDE.

2. Import the following contracts from the OpenZeppelin library:

    * `ERC20`

    * `ERC20Detailed`

    * `ERC20Mintable`

3. Define a contract for the KaseiCoin token called `KaseiCoin`, and have the contract inherit the three contracts that you just imported from OpenZeppelin.

4. Inside of your `KaseiCoin` contract, add a constructor with the following parameters: `name`, `symbol`, and `initial_supply`.

5. Then, as part of your constructor definition, add a call to the `ERC20Detailed` contractâ€™s constructor, passing the parameters `name`, `symbol`, and `18`. Recall that 18 is the value for the `decimal` parameter.


6. Compile the contract using compiler version 0.5.0.

7. Check for any errors and debug as needed.

8. Take a screenshot of the successful compilation of the contract, and add it to the Evaluation Evidence section of the `README.md` file for your Challenge repository.
